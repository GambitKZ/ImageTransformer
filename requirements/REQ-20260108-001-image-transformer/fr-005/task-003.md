# Task 003: Update Processing Loop for JPEG Handling

Modify the image processing loop in Program.cs to call ProcessJpegImage for JPEG files (.jpg, .jpeg) instead of copying them directly. Ensure the method is awaited properly and update any related messages.

Deliverable: Updated Program.cs with the modified processing logic for JPEG files. (Depends on Tasks 001 and 002.)

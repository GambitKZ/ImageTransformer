# Task 005: Update Processing Loop for PNG Handling

Modify the image processing loop in Program.cs to inject and use IImageProcessor. For each scanned image, check if it's a PNG and call ProcessPngImage; for JPEGs, copy the file to the output folder. Update the progress display accordingly.

Deliverable: Updated Program.cs with the processing logic implemented. (Depends on Tasks 002, 003, and 004.)

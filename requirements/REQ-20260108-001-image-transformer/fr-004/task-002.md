# Task 002: Create IImageProcessor Interface

Define the IImageProcessor interface in the Interfaces folder with a ProcessPngImage method that takes an input file path and output directory, handles size checking against the configured threshold, and performs conversion or copying as needed.

Deliverable: New IImageProcessor.cs file created in the Interfaces folder.
